	<div class="squats"> <h2>Wall squats</h2></br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">If you have pain from an injury or condition such as arthritis, moves like the wall squat can be a good way to do muscle-strengthening exercise in a more gentle way. That’s because wall squats add an isometric pause — meaning part of the squat is held in a static position — which gives you added benefits of strength training. Isometric exercises also improve joint stability and mobility. So find a nearby wall — that’s all you need to get started!</p></div>
