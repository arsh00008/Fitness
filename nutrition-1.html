<div class="nain-2"><h2>start with whole-grian cereal</h2><br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat’s B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.</p></div>

	<div class="gur"><h2>BLACK BEAN BURGER</h2><br>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">When you eat a lot of hamburgers from fast-food joints or cooked at home, you're also ingesting a lot of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) with condiments like ketchup, barbecue sauce, pickle relish, and even the bun. This inexpensive corn sweetener is notorious for quickly raising blood sugar. Over time, high blood sugar can lead to insulin resistance and pre-diabetes, and eventually full-blown type 2 diabetes. The fact that most burger buns are made with bleached white flour, which is devoid of fiber, doesn't help either.A study in Circulation found that people who ate at fast-food restaurants more than twice a week had a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of health problems that include high blood sugar and a poor cholesterol profile, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease than people who reported not eating fast food.</p></div>

		<p style="font-size:20px;">Huckleberries are sweet, tart, purple berries and are slightly smaller than blueberries. There’s no good method to commercially farm them, so you have to forage for huckleberries in the wild in places such as Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana.You can eat huckleberries raw, or use them in jams, syrups, and other foods. They're packed with more antioxidants than blueberries.Gooseberries are small, tart, and juicy and can be green, red, or purple. They're low in calories and fat but loaded with vitamin C and fiber, as well as copper, manganese, and potassium.Marionberries are a variety of the blackberry bred by the USDA in Marion County, Oregon, in the late 1940s. Today most marionberries are still grown and harvested in Marion. They're usually ready to pick in late July and are best when frozen.
