	<div class="workout-1"><h2>what type of training should I do to lose weight</h2><br><p>Weight training can help build strength and promote muscle growth, raising your resting metabolic rate (RMR), or how many calories your body burns at rest.

The American Council on Exercise estimates that a 140-pound (65-kg) person burns about 7.6 calories per minute of weight training. A 180-pound person burns about 9.8 calories per minute of weight training.One 6-month studyTrusted Source showed that doing 11 minutes of strength-based exercises three times per week resulted in an average 7.4% increase in metabolic rate. In this study, that increase was equivalent to burning an additional 125 calories per day.Another studyTrusted Source found that 24 weeks of weight training led to a 9% increase in men’s metabolic rate, equating to burning approximately 140 more calories per day. Among women, the increase in metabolic rate was nearly 4% or 50 more calories per day.In addition, studies have shownTrusted Source that your body continues to burn calories many hours after a weight-training workout, compared with aerobic exercise.</p><br>
<p>According to a study sponsored by the American Council on Exercise, a person weighing around 140 pounds (64 kg) would burn 108 calories at a 30-minute beginner’s Pilates class or 168 calories at an advanced class of the same duration.
Although Pilates may not burn as many calories as aerobic exercises like running, many people find it enjoyable, which makes it easier to stick to over time.
An 8-week studyTrusted Source in 37 middle-aged women found that performing Pilates exercises for 90 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced waist, stomach, and hip circumference, compared with a control group that did no exercise over the same period.Pilates may also reduceTrusted Source lower back pain and improveTrusted Source strength, balance, flexibility, endurance, and overall fitness.
You can do Pilates at home or at one of the many gyms that offer Pilates classes.
To further boost weight loss with Pilates, combine it with a balanced diet and other forms of exercise, such as weight training or cardio.</p></div>
